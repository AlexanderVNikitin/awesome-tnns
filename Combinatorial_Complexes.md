## Test

As of yet, only one paper has published a TNN opertaing in the combinatorial complex domain. Due to the complexity of these schemes and the (temporary) lack of possible comparisons, we provide graphical illustrations for the four proposed architectures for now.

Note: these graphical illustrations, called tensor diagrams, are outlined in Section 2.3.2 of the paper. We use them to describe each TNN (Fig. 10 of the paper), allowing even the most complex architectures in a largely unexplored domain to be compared with other models from different domains.
